Curse those *&%#@!^)&%#^&

A string of colourful words escaped his mouth, much unlike his usual polite facade. He was in deep ****. One moment he was walking home, the next some random men in black tackled him, gagged him, place a bag over his head, shove him in a truck and drove him to this &^%$ *!@#$% place. Where they oh so gently dumped him. 

It was dark, with only light from the torches hung at intervals of 10 feet on the walls. A cold wind blew towards him from upfront, but all he saw was darkness. The lights from the torches could only illuminate so much. Daniel observed his surroundings while treading across the hall. He wanted to call out, but he had a hunch that something would come for him should he shout. Something ominous. Something dangerous. Something that could very well send him to hell.

Tiny spiders crawled along the walls, across the dusty concrete floor. Soon, the path he was walkng on split into two. One going to his left, the other heading to his right. Which one should he take? He looked to both paths back and forth. After a moment, he gulped down the lump in his throat and turned to his right. But just as he turned, a cool hand reached out and touched the back of his neck. It slid across to his adam's apple. Cold sweat slid down his stiff back, as he suppressed a scream. His heart was threatening to just jump out and run away. He stood there, rooted to the ground, when from his peripheral  vision, he saw a something long and black. It was hair, greasy and tangled together. Just then , a skeleton hand appeared before his view, slowly but surely, coming closer and closer to cover his eyes.
